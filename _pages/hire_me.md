title: Hire me
---

I'm Michael, based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I've made a living as a programmer since 2007 and I now run a consultancy that helps customers do things with computers.

Since you're reading this, I'm assuming that you read one of my blog posts and thought it reasonated with you somehow. That makes me happy! Or, perhaps you're furious and need to tell me how wrong I am. In that case, do tell! I love learning :)

You can hire me on an hourly, weekly, or monthly basis. Depending on the type of project, I'm also available for longer contracts.

My contact information is at [the bottom of the page](#contact).


## Experience

I love working behind the scenes, doing backend, infrastructure, and systems programming. Basically anywhere that maintainability, correctness, and performance are important factors, and where people mostly expect things to Just Workâ„¢.

I have experience form the following industries:

- Health care (Novo Nordisk, Adent Health)
- Semiconductors/systems programming research (Samsung Research)
- Banking (Danske Bank)
- Gaming (noesis.gg)
- Real estate (Ejendomstorvet)
- Consulting (Eksponent, Big Bang Holding)

On a contract, I'm happy to help in any way that I can; architecting, writing code, mentoring, doing code reviews, setting up CI/CD pipelines. All of it is important and required for teams to be great. I'm pragmatic, open, easy-going, and I love keeping things light and fun. I'm professional and I'm on time.

I care deeply about, and have proven experience with:

- writing testable, maintainable code 
- writing tests that actually provide value
- designing and implementing greenfield projects
- improving maintainability and testability of existing systems
- using performance profiling to guide development
- mentoring
- doing code reviews
- technical writing

I'm also experienced with technical reviewing, having reviewed:

- Matt Boyle's [Foundations of Debugging with Go](https://www.bytesizego.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-debugging-with-go-book)
- Inanc Gumus's [Go by Example](https://www.manning.com/books/go-by-example)
- Bartlomiej Plotka's [Efficient Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/efficient-go/9781098105709/)
