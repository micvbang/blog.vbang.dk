title: Hire me
---

I'm Michael, based in Copenhagen, Denmark, and I run a small company providing IT consulting services. I've made a living as a programmer since 2007.

Since you're reading this, I'm assuming that you read one of my blog posts and thought it reasonated with you somehow. That makes me happy! Or, perhaps you're furious and need to tell me how wrong I am. In that case, do tell! I love learning :)

You can hire me on an hourly, weekly, or monthly basis. Depending on the type of project, I'm also available for longer contracts.

I have proven experience in  web backend [1](https://danskebank.dk/privat/produkter/investering/alle-produkter/june) [2](https://noesis.gg) [3](https://cvr.dev) [4](https://www.adent-health.com/), translating customer requirements into working code [1]](/static/references/Ejendomstorvet - Jonas Krat.pdf) [2], mentoring [1](/static/references/FOSS - Nicolas aRogvi.pdf) [2](/static/references/Novo Nordisk - Joanna Sharman-Soares.pdf) [3](/static/references/Ejendomstorvet - Jonas Krat.pdf), [systems programming](https://xnvme.io), and more.

On a contract, I'm happy to help in any way that I can; architecting, implementing, mentoring, doing code reviews, all of it is important and contributes to a great team. I care a lot about, and have a lot of experience with:

- writing testable, maintainable code 
- mentoring
- designing and implementing greenfield projects
- improving maintainability and testability of existing systems
- using performance profiling to guide development
- doing code reviews
