title: Hire me
---

Since you're reading this, I'm assuming that you read one of my blog posts and thought it reasonated with you somehow. That makes me happy!

I'm Michael, based in Copenhagen, Denmark, and I run a small company providing IT consulting services. I've made a living programming since 2007.

You can hire me on an hourly, weekly, or monthly. Depending on the type of project, I'm also available for longer contracts.

On a contract, I'm happy to help in any way that I can. 

I have a lot of experience with the following:

- writing testable, maintainable code 
- doing code reviews
- mentoring
- designing and implementing greenfield projects
- improving maintainability and testability of existing systems
- using performance profiling to improve systems

But you don't have to take my word for it; below are some references I've received from previous employers:
